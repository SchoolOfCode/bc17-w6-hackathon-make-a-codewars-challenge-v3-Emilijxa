# SPACED-THEMED CODING (KATA)

## Sum of Arrays in Space ##

Welcome Space Traveler! Your task is to gather valuable resources from different planets in faraway galaxies. Each planet has an array of resource values, and your mission is to write a function that sums up these values to find the total resources collected.

* I employed the **Disney Creative Strategy**  to come up with kata ideas:
    * **The Dreamer:** Wrote down the most crazy, creative ideas I can come up with such as treasure hunt, puzzles, tic-tac-toe.

    * **The Realist:** Evaluated the ideas based on my current skills and the amount of time given to complete. Whilst there were some great ideas, just seemed to complex to actually create.

    * **The Critic:** Assessed the possibility of each idea and then just focused on what I could realistically achieve.

Ended up chosing **space theme** to make it more adventurous and the idea of collecting resources from different planets to make the challenge more engaging, also chose a straightforward challenge that sums up the arrays. 

### Writing the Kata ###

Went through a few kata challenges in Codewars to get the idea of how to write it. 

- Wrote the instructions in 'main.js' that were easy to understand. Made sure whoever reads it knows exactly what to do. 

- Wrote out skeleton function, following the same format as in Codewars katas.

- TDD: Wrote out test cases in 'main.test.js' before implementing the solution. Focused on expected outcomes.

- To ensure tests covered many scenarios, I used **Equivalency Partitioning** and **Boundary Value Analysis** such as empty arrays and arrays with negative numbers.

- To test it I added a working function and ensured it passed, and failed without the solution. 

# Bonus Challenge

## Temperature Converter in Space ##

During your travelling journey, you'll come across planets with temperatures measured in Celsius. Your mission is to convert these temperatures to Fahrenheit so they can be understood across the galaxy. 

- When I completed the first kata, I still had quite a lot of time left until you needed to submit the repo so I decided to do another challenge.

- Struggled to come up with challenges this time so I asked chatGPT to give me loads of random ideas that I can use with space theme, loved the temperature converter so decided to stick with that. 

- Did the same as with the previous kata which is writingclear instructions, creating skeleton function but for making different test cases I used temperature conversion table image that I have found on google to use all sorts of extreme values and also included negative numbers.
